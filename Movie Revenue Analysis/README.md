# Movie Revenue Analysis in R

This project was a voluntary activity at work for fun. As is listed in the "Rules" tab of the dataset (movie_data_r.xlsx), this was an exercise using film data. Our team is made up of business performance analysts and this exercise was to push our boundaries creatively. That is why I chose to utilize RStudio to generate a scatterplot.
## Installation

Necessary libraries

```bash
library(ggimage)
library(ggplot2)
library(readxl)
library(QuantPsyc)
```
    
## Data Sources

Data was obtained from my manager at work, so I am uncertain of the exact repository he had gotten it from. The movie information is fairly generic and not obtain via private API.


## Results and Evaluation

The scatterplot I generated showed the relationship between film runtime and revenue. Only five films showed as having a gross revenue over $2B. Two of those five films had a runtime over 150 minutes. It was interesting to see outliers such as Lord of the Rings Return of the King being the longest runtime film in the dataset, but also one of the lower revenue generators at less than $1.25B.
