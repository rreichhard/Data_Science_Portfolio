# LSTM Text Generation of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein

This project involved utilizing the Keras library and Long-Short Term Memory in order to generate new text using Mary Shelley's Frankenstein as the seed-text.
## Installation

Necessary libraries

```bash
import keras
from keras import layers
import random
import sys
import numpy as np
```
    
## Data Sources

Data was obtained from https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/84 courtesy of the Gutenberg Project.


## Results and Evaluation

It was found through various epochs and randomness that having a temperature closer to 1.0 led to more understandable text.
