## Data Science Portfolio

### Introduction

Welcome to my Data Science Portfolio page. I am so glad you found me! My name is Robert, but I typically go by *R.J.* I am currently a Business Performance Analyst for an online payment broker. While I am fortunate to be able to work in the data realm, my goal is to increase my footprint and responsibilities. That is where the Data Science M.S. program with Bellevue University stepped in.
I have learned a great deal in this program and am excited to share with you the projects I have completed.

### How to Use

Each of these projects has a README.md file that will outline the necessary libraries for each file. Data sources are housed in the "DATA" folder of this repository unless stated otherwise.

Some of these projects were completed as coursework through Bellevue University. Others were completed as voluntary "data challenges" in light-hearted competition with my coworkers. These challenge-projects aimed to be a low stakes way of letting the analysts stretch our metaphorical wings and try something new.
