## Data Science Portfolio

---

### Hello!
#### Welcome to my Data Science Portfolio page. I am so glad you found me! My name is Robert, but I typically go by *R.J.* I am currently a Business Performance Analyst for an online payment broker. While I am fortunate to be able to work in the data realm, my goal is to increase my footprint and responsibilities. That is where the Data Science M.S. program with Bellevue University stepped in.

#### I have learned a great deal in this program and am excited to share with you the projects I have completed. Please take a look at the list below; links go directly to my github repository.

### About Me/My Data Journey

#### My data journey began as I'm sure many do, in an unrelated field. My post-secondary education is in teaching & educational administration. I taught Physical Education at the elementary & middle/junior high school levels as well as coached football and track & field. I greatly enjoyed teaching and the students were wonderful. Unfortunately, the public education industry in Arizona is rather unreliable and I found myself without a multi-year contract or continuing healthcare coverage year after year. 

#### During one of the summertime races for alternative employment before the next school year's contracts were offered, I applied for a call-center position for an online credit provider. I immediately fell in love with the company's culture and working in an office. After working there for two months my previous school district offered me another year's contract. I weighed my options (outside in the Arizona sun 8+ hours/day teaching students vs an air-conditioned office with comfortable chairs and free soda & bagels). I listened to my family and my conscience and went back to teaching. I made sure to leave on good terms and could never quite get that call-center out of the back of my mind.

#### Two years later I was done with teaching (or rather teaching was done with me) and after trying my hand at construction in the oil boom of North Dakota, I was back to job hunting. I reached out to the site manager from the call-center position I had left on good terms and inquired about coming back. Much to my surprise this company had leased a brand new office building much closer to my home and was hiring. I applied, interviewed, and was hired as a customer service representative. I flourished at this position with a combination of domain knowledge, soft skills, and a newfound technical skillset.

#### Another two years later I had been promoted twice and was now leading a team of representatives on my own. People leadership positions were the only way to expand my career at the time so I dove into it headfirst. After another 5 years I found myself no longer enjoying people-leading, but enjoying every other aspect of my career including the company. This led to an uncomfortable, but necessary conversation with my manager about what can I do to stay with the company in an alternative role. Thankfully my manager viewed this as an opportunity for us both to explore what individual contributor positions may be available. A few weeks later I was in a new position as a "Team Support Leader"! I could do all of the administrative things I had found myself appreciating such as attendance and report generation, but without an actual team of representatives to be directly responsible for leading. This is where I feel I truly flourished. A co-worker at the time (and now close friend) introduced me to the world of Tableau and everything changed. My data journey had begun in earnest. I no longer had the "Sunday Scaries" dreading the thought of going to work on Monday morning; I relished getting back to work! I would spend free time on the weekend watching youtube tutorials, looking at dashboards online, and mulling over problems in my head to draft up solutions. 

#### One spring my employer had announced a new partnership with Bellevue University. Employees were encouraged to apply for educational programs at multiple levels. After a fateful conversation with a Bellevue enrollment manager I was applying for the M.S. in Data Science program. I wanted to be successful and not get burned out so I took one class at a time. After a few regular breaks for mental health/holidays and about 5 years later, I am set to graduate. This program has helped me develop a strong passion for data integrity, cleaning/wrangling, and presentation. I have always been a fan of data visualization, but this program forced me to branch outside of my Tableau-bubble and learn additional programs such as PowerBI and using matplotlib via Python in Jupyter notebooks.

#### I take pride in my work as I feel it represents me remotely in a digital format as I am grateful to be able to work from home. This portfolio and the projects above showcase hands-on projects I have completed through classwork or also personal projects done on my own. My manager is a big fan of quarterly "Data Challenges" where we analysts get to work on datasets of our own choosing and visualize what we find. This has generated some interesting and passionate projects that I am proud to share with everyone on here.
